   * Class SolventTopology
   * Purpose: Contains all topological information for a solvent Molecule
   *
   * Description:
   * The SolventTopology contains all topological information for a solvent 
   * molecule. In gromos a solvent molecule is treates different from a 
   * regular molecule: All atoms are excluded and in stead of bonds, angles
   * etc. the molecule is kept rigid by a set of distance restraints.<br>
   * For the Atoms there is a direct accessor to the AtomTopologies, but 
   * these Constraints you access via a ConstraintIterator.

     * Constraints in a SolventTopology. 
     * It is constructed with the SolventTopology as an argument. Use the 
     * ++ operator to move to the next Constraint. The () operator returns 
     * the current Constraint. 
     * This can also be used as a boolean: the bool() returns 1 as long as 
     * the iterator is not at the end of the Constraint list.
