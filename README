1. Libraries:
   ----------
   GROMOS++ can be linked to both, dyamic and static
   libraries. (See also configure options.) To compile
   and link, libtool is used.

   Debugging: 
   libtool generates a wrapper script to run the 
   programme, even when it is not installed.
   The actual programme is generated in a
   subdirectory .libs. Therefore, libtool has to be called
   to debug the code:
  
   libtool gdb <prog>

   Installation:
   Install using libtool:
   libtool install -c <prog> <dest>
   See libtool documentation for further questions.


2. Editing configuration files
   ---------------------------
   Most of the configuration files are automatically generated.
   Editing them would mean to have them overwritten the next
   time they are generated. Files to edit:

   - Makefile.am (template for automake)
   - configure.in (template for autoconf)
   - acinclude.m4 (macros for autoconf)


3. Dependencies:
   -------------
   Dependencies are generated with automake by
   automake -i --generate-deps --build-dir=<dir> --srcdir-name=<dir>
