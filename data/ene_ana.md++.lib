ENERTRJ
# block definition for the energy trajectory file.
# which is specified by the input flag en_files of program ene_ana.
#
# Use keyword 'block' to specify the blocks
#             'subblock' to specify name and dimensions of a set of data
#             'size' to specify a size that should be read in from the file
#                    this size can be used as dimension specification
#                    in a subblock definition. Using the prefix 'matrix_'
#                    with such a definition will expand the size N to
#                    N*(N+1)/2

VARIABLES
# Here you can define variables to be calculated by the program ene_ana
# In principal the program refers to the blocknames you have defined above,
# accessing individual element using array indices (one- or two-dimensional)
#
# Predefined as well is the Boltzmann constant (as BOLTZ = 0.00831441) and
# the MASS which (if not present in the energy trajectory) will be calculated
# from the topology (if inputflag @topo is given).
#
# Additional properties can be defined here as a direct mapping of a known 
# property or as an expression of such properties. Make sure that variables
# and operators are always seperated by spaces. Multi-line expressions are
# allowed.
#
# Examples that work with the standard gromos96 definition are
#          given below and are actually standardly define if no library
#          file is specified.

# Example: Heat of vaporization (Hvap)
#
# Neglecting quantum corrections for rigid bonds
# and intermolecular vibrational energies,
# Hvap can be estimated as
#
# Hvap = Ugas - Uliq + RT
#
# where Ugas and Uliq are the total potential energies
# of a single molecule in the gas and liquid phase, respectively, 
# R denotes the gas constant and T the absolute temperature.
# To calculate Hvap from an energy trajectory obtained 
# from a condensed phase simulation, Ugas = GASENER 
# has to be provided (e.g. from a separate simulation)
# along with the number of molecules, NUMMOL, in the box  
# and the temperature TEMP, e.g:
#
# TEMP = 300.0
# GASENER = 0
# NUMMOL = 512
# hvap = GASENER - ENER[3] / NUMMOL + BOLTZ * TEMP

# Alternatively the temperature can be made available 
# from the appropriate entry in the TEMPERATURE
